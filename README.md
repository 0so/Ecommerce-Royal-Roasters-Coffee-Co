# Royal-Roasters-Coffee-Co
</br>
An e-commerce website developed using PHP, stylized with CSS, and with a database written in SQL to provide customers with an authentic shopping experience.</br>
Using phpMyAdmin and MySQL, a database consisting of coffee products, customer and employee account information, a customer's itemized cart, and a personalized order history system was constructed that was queried and manipulated in almost every page of the website. </br>
No credit card or other forms of payment information was taken or stored due to project guidelines; no profit was made from the products displayed.</br>
Website security consists of, but not limited to, anti-tunneling, SQL injection protection, and hashed passwords.</br>
Designed and hosted by Gelber Castillo, assisted by Samuel Rufino.
